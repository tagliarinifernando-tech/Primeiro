  Drop one image and get a handcrafted paper-cut stop-motion video: the skill writes the three prompts (paper-cut image, 9-panel sheet, animation) and generates each step on the user's Higgsfield account only after showing the credit cost and getting an ok (or hands over the prompts to run in any other tool). Trigger whenever the user wants a paper-cut / torn-paper / paper-collage / stop-motion assembly / "motion design" animation.

# Motion Design — Paper-Cut (Prompt Mode)

Drop one image → this walks you through making a handcrafted **stop-motion paper-collage**
video. It **looks at what you drop and writes the exact prompt** for each step, then generates
it on your Higgsfield account — **only after you see the credit cost and say ok** (or you run the
prompt in your own tool and drop the result back). Then it hands you the next one.

Three prompts, one workflow: **paper-cut image → 9-panel sheet → animation.** No credit
is spent unless you approve the cost of a generation.

## How to run this skill (read first)

- **Start silently.** No "I'll follow the skill" / "let me check setup" preamble — open at
  Step 1 by asking the project name.
- **Every invocation starts at Step 1.**
- **Formatting matters a lot here.** Every prompt goes in its own fenced ```code block``` so
  it's one-click copyable. Every hand-off is a clean **brief** (see the exact shapes below) —
  short labelled lines, blank lines for breathing room, never a wall of text.
- **Generation — only with the user's OK (hard lock).** This skill writes the prompt AND can generate it on the user's Higgsfield account. Before the first generation, read `skill-packs/higgsfield-protocol.md` (repo root) and follow it exactly: never spend a credit without first showing, on a generation card, the current balance (`balance`), the exact cost (same params + `get_cost: true`) and the balance after — then STOP and generate only after an explicit "ok" to that card. Wherever this file tells the user to run, paste, attach or generate a prompt in their own tool, show the generation card instead (the settings table maps onto it; approved results feed later steps by `job_id`). If the user says "só o prompt" / wants to run it themselves, hand off as before (prompt + settings table + attachments).
- In this repo each "**Now generate it:**" brief becomes the generation card (image steps: `gpt_image_2`, quality high; video step: `seedance_2_5`, 10s, 720p, your aspect, audio on). An approved result is used by the next step via its `job_id` — no need to save it into `reference/`. The user's own starting image is uploaded to Higgsfield per the protocol.

## Step 1 — Name the project, then drop the image

Ask only this first:

> **What should we call this project?** (e.g. `wolf`, `ferrari`, `football` — whatever you're making)

Slug it (lowercase-hyphen) and create the folder, then capture the **full absolute path** so
you can show the user exactly where to drop:

```bash
mkdir -p "<project>/reference" && echo "$(pwd)/<project>/reference/"
```

Show this message — note the **full path on its own line, with blank lines around it**:

> ✅ Project **`<project>`** created.
>
> Drop the image you want to animate into:
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/full/absolute/path/<project>/reference/`
>
> Any image works — a photo, poster, product, or artwork.
> Once it's in, just say **done**.

On "done", detect the newest file and **look at it**:

```bash
ls -t "<project>/reference/" | head -5
```

The file at the **top of `ls -t` (most recently added) is the subject** they just dropped.
**Remember the filenames you've seen** — at every later step, the *new* file at the top of
`ls -t` is the result of the prompt you just handed over (so the original never gets confused
with the paper-cut, and the paper-cut never gets confused with the sheet).

---

## Step 2 — Hand over the PAPER-CUT prompt

Look at the subject image and write ONE image-generation prompt that recreates it as a
torn-paper collage. Put it in a code block, one paragraph:
- First, concisely describe what's actually in the image: subject, pose, key colors, layout,
  any text/numbers.
- Then append this STYLE BLOCK verbatim: *"Built entirely from layered cut-and-torn paper pieces: every shape is a separate flat paper cutout with rough torn edges, visible paper grain and fibre texture, and a hard drop shadow beneath it. Small rough white negative-space slivers show between the pieces. Muted, tactile, slightly desaturated color treatment. A mosaic of overlapping paper facets, like a real handmade paper artwork photographed under soft directional light. No smooth gradients, no digital flatness, no glossy 3D — it must look like real cut paper."*
- Keep the subject, composition, and colors; change only the material to paper.

Present it EXACTLY in this shape (heading → code block → labelled brief):

> Here's your **paper-cut prompt** — it recreates [one-line description of their image] as a
> torn-paper collage:
>
> ```
> [the prompt]
> ```
>
> **Now generate it:**
>
> - 🎨 **Platform:** your preferred image generation platform
> - 🤖 **Model:** **GPT Image 2.0**
> - 📎 **Attach:** your original image
> - 💾 **Save the result** into `/full/path/<project>/reference/` and say **done**

On "done", `ls -t` the folder → the new top file is the paper-cut image → look at it.

---

## Step 3 — Action

> **Every paper-cut motion starts with the assembly** — the scene builds itself out of torn
> paper, then settles.
>
> **After it's assembled, you can add motion** — e.g. *the car drives off · the figure runs
> and lifts away · a ball is kicked and confetti scatters.*
>
> Want to add motion? Tell me what happens — or say **no** for pure assembly.

Store as the action note.

---

## Step 4 — Hand over the SHEET prompt

Write ONE image-generation prompt for a clean **storyboard sheet** — a 3×3 grid of 9 panels
showing the scene assembling piece by piece. Code block, one paragraph:
- NO text, NO labels, NO captions, NO numbers anywhere in the grid.
- Build far-to-near across the panels: Panel 1 a near-empty frame with the first background
  pieces (sky/back wall) sliding in; then ground rises in; environment & set pieces slide in;
  background crowd builds; props settle; the hero figure(s) assemble part by part; if an
  action was requested, the second-to-last panel shows that beat; the final panel is the
  complete composition matching the paper-cut image.
- Keep the SAME paper-cut look in every panel (torn edges, grain, hard shadows, white slivers,
  same palette). End by restating: no text or writing in any panel.

Present it EXACTLY in this shape:

> Here's your **storyboard-sheet prompt** — a 9-panel grid showing the whole assembly:
>
> ```
> [the prompt]
> ```
>
> **Now generate it:**
>
> - 🎨 **Platform:** your preferred image generation platform
> - 🤖 **Model:** **GPT Image 2.0**
> - 📐 **Aspect ratio:** the format you want the final video — **16:9 / 9:16 / 1:1**
> - 📎 **Attach:** the **paper-cut image you just generated**
> - 💾 **Save the sheet** into `/full/path/<project>/reference/` and say **done**

On "done", `ls -t` → the new top file is the sheet → look at it.

## Step 5 — Hand over the ANIMATION prompt

Write ONE animation prompt as a single paragraph in a code block, in this FIXED ORDER. The
OPENING line and the three CLOSING blocks are verbatim constants — never reword. Describe only
what's visible in the scene.

1. OPENING (verbatim): *"Animate this as a handcrafted stop-motion paper collage assembly. Every element must enter the frame as a flat pre-cut torn paper piece pushed in from outside the frame."*
2. ASSEMBLY BODY — silently sort back-to-front, then describe entrances in that order: back layer (sky/wall) from above and the sides; ground from below in layered strips; environment & set pieces from the sides and top; background crowd row by row; props settle; hero figure(s) LAST, part by part (base-up: legs/feet → clothing → torso → arms → hands → head → features → hair last; for a face: jaw → cheeks → nose → forehead → eyes with tiny white catchlight flecks → eyebrows → hair). Each object gets a hard paper shadow beneath it; details/numbers/logos enter as separate small cutouts.
3. OPTIONAL ACTION BEAT — only if requested. After assembly, introduced with *"As the final beat…"*. One clear beat. Paper-legal verbs only (slide, drop, rotate, tumble, lift, plant, scatter, tip, swing, snap forward, drive off); locomotion = *"flat cutout limbs sliding and swapping mid-stride in choppy stop-motion steps."* Never morph/fold/bend/smooth. Chain cause→effect (kick → ball → net → confetti; grab string → balloon lifts figure → out of frame; engine starts → car drives off → paper exhaust puff). Payoff = "tiny scattered paper flecks." No action → end on *"all pieces settle and lock into place with tiny staggered adjustments."*
4. STYLE (verbatim): *"Motion should feel tactile, slightly imperfect, editorial, and stop-motion realistic, with tiny misalignments, staggered timing, hard shadows, rough white torn edges, overlapping paper layers, and visible paper texture."*
5. NEGATIVE (verbatim): *"No folding, no morphing, no in-place drawing, no smooth digital animation. Every piece is a pre-made flat cutout sliding, rotating, or dropping into place."*
6. SOUND (verbatim): *"Sound design: ASMR paper-only foley, including soft paper slides, taps, shuffles, drops, and friction. No music, no voice, no ambient sound, no extra effects."*

Present it EXACTLY in this shape:

> Here's your **animation prompt** — this is the one that brings it to life:
>
> ```
> [the prompt]
> ```
>
> **Now generate it:**
>
> - 🎬 **Platform:** your preferred video generation platform
> - 🤖 **Model:** **Seedance 2.0**
> - 📎 **Attach:** your **9-panel sheet** as the starting / reference frame
> - ⚙️ **Settings:** 10s · 720p · your aspect ratio · audio on
>
> 🎉 That's your paper-cut motion clip!

## Step 6 — Done / another

Offer: run another image (back to Step 1), redo a step's prompt, or done.

## Guards & notes

- **Never name real public figures or famous artworks** in any prompt — describe them
  generically ("a footballer in a yellow jersey," "a girl reaching for a balloon"). The visual
  still reads correctly.
- Every prompt = one paragraph, no line breaks inside it; the 4 constants are verbatim.
- **Always state the Model explicitly, on its own line:** **GPT Image 2.0** for both image
  steps, **Seedance 2.0** for the video step. Platform stays "your preferred … platform"; the
  Model line is fixed. Keep each brief to: platform → model → (aspect ratio for the sheet) →
  attach → save. Never list a menu of tools or extra attachments.
- This skill generates **only through the gate** (balance + cost card + explicit ok); otherwise it writes prompts and detects what you drop back.
- If the user would rather just **paste a generated image into the chat** instead of saving to
  `reference/`, that's fine too — look at the attached image and continue.
