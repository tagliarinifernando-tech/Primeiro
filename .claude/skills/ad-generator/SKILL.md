name: ad-generator
description: Generate premium static-ad image prompts for any brand from 40 battle-tested ad templates. Use whenever the user wants ads, static ads, ad creative, ad prompts, or advertisement images for a product or brand — "make ads", "generate an ad", "create ad creative", "ad prompt for my product". First run sets the brand up automatically from its website (or a short manual form); every ad prompt is then filled with that brand's real colors, voice, and product facts. Then it generates the ads on the user's Higgsfield account (GPT Image 2) with ONE product photo as reference — only after showing the balance and exact credit cost and getting an explicit ok — or hands over the prompts to run in any image tool.

# Ad Generator

Pick from 40 battle-tested ad templates. Claude fills your pick with your brand's DNA — real colors, real voice, real product facts — and hands you a finished, copy-paste image-generation prompt.

Then I can generate the ads for you on your Higgsfield account with GPT Image 2 — the reference model these templates were built for — using one product photo you send. **Only after you see your balance and the exact credit cost and say ok.** Prefer your own tool? Say **só o prompt**.

**Generation — only with the user's OK (hard lock).** Before the first generation, read `skill-packs/higgsfield-protocol.md` (repo root) and follow it exactly: never spend a credit without first showing, on a generation card, the current balance (`balance`), the exact cost (same params + `get_cost: true`) and the balance after — then STOP and generate only after an explicit "ok" to that card. The brief's "go" (Step 4) approves the copy, never a spend.

Everything runs in ONE flow: if your brand isn't set up yet, a 2-minute express setup happens first — then you land in the template menu. If your brand is already set up, you land in the menu immediately.

## Step 0 — Brand check

Look for existing brands: scan `./brands/` for subfolders containing a `brand-dna.md` (ignore dotfiles).

- **Found** → list them, ask which brand to use (auto-select if exactly one, but confirm it by name). Then skip to **Step 2**.
- **None** → first run. Say: "Let's set up your brand first — takes about two minutes." Continue with Step 1.

## Step 1 — Express brand setup (first run only)

Ask ONE question:

> "Give me your brand's **website URL** and I'll set everything up myself — or say **manual** if you'd rather answer a few quick questions."

### Auto path (URL)

1. Fetch the homepage with WebFetch and read it fully. Also fetch one product page, and the About page if discoverable from homepage links.
2. Extract — specific to THIS brand, never generic:
   - **Voice** — 5 precise adjectives from how they actually write
   - **Colors** — dominant, accent, background; estimate hex codes from what you observe (estimates beat blanks)
   - **Typography** — headline weight/style, body treatment (describe the style; don't guess font names)
   - **Photography** — lighting, color grade, surfaces, what's in frame
   - **Packaging** — physical form, label
   - **Target audience** — one sentence
3. Write `brands/[brand-slug]/brand-dna.md` (slug = lowercase, hyphens, drop legal suffixes) using EXACTLY this structure:

```
# [Brand Name] — Brand DNA

## Identity
**Name:** [as the brand writes it]
**Positioning:** [one sentence]
**Voice:** [five adjectives]
**Target audience:** [one sentence]

## Color System
Lead:        [name] — [hex]
Support:     [name] — [hex]
Accent:      [name] — [hex]
Background:  [name] — [hex]
Off-limits:  [what never appears]

## Typography
Headline:    [style/weight]
Body:        [style]
Treatment:   [distinctive choices]
In ads:      [how type sits in their ads]

## Photography Style
- **Lighting:** [...]
- **What's in frame:** [...]
- **Color grade:** [...]
- **Setting:** [...]
- **Composition:** [...]
- **Mood:** [3–5 adjectives]

## The Product
Form:       [form factor and material]
Label:      [label text, typography, placement]

## Ad Creative Style
Formats:      [best guess]
Text on image: [how copy sits]
Visual style:  [photo-led / product-only / lifestyle / mixed]
Current ads:   not researched (express setup)

## Voice in Practice
Sounds like: "[example sentence in brand voice]"
Never:       "[example of wrong tone]"

## Hard Rules
Always: [non-negotiable visual rule]
Always: [non-negotiable visual rule]
Never:  [visual rule]
Never:  [visual rule]
```

4. List the products you saw on the site ("Which product are we making ads for? 1. ... 2. ..."). When the user picks, fetch that product's page and write `brands/[brand-slug]/product-dna/[product-slug].md`:

```
# [Product Name] — Product DNA

## Identity
**Category:** [...]
**Sizes / flavors / scents:** [...]

## What it does
**Tagline:** [one-liner]
**Description:** [1–2 sentences]

## Key benefits
- [specific benefit]
- [...]

## Ingredients / materials
- [...]
- Notable absences: [free of X, Y]

## Positioning
[1–2 sentences vs alternatives]
```

Real facts from the page only; mark anything assumed with ⚠️.

5. Confirm in one compact message: brand name, voice line, colors, chosen product. Then continue straight to Step 3 — no approval pause.

### Manual path

Ask everything in ONE grouped message:

```
Quick brand setup — answer what you know, skip the rest:

Brand name:
Positioning (who it's for, what it does):
Brand voice (5 adjectives):
Primary / accent / background colors:
Headline typography style (e.g. bold sans-serif all-caps):
Photography style (lighting, mood, settings):
Product (name, what it is, physical form, label):
Key product facts (benefits, ingredients, real numbers you use):
```

Write `brand-dna.md` and `product-dna/[product-slug].md` from the answers (same structures; empty stays empty). Continue to Step 3.

## Step 2 — Select product (returning brands)

Read `brands/[brand]/brand-dna.md` in full — hold the color system (hex values), typography rules, and brand voice as live context. List the products that have a file in `brands/[brand]/product-dna/` plus "add a new product". If the user adds a new one: ask for the product page URL (auto-fill) or the key facts (manual), write its `product-dna/[slug].md`, continue.

## Step 3 — Show template menu

Read `.claude/skills/ad-generator/templates.md`. Display the full numbered list:

```

Wait for selection.

## Step 4 — Campaign brief

For each selected template, auto-suggest every piece of text a viewer would read on the ad (headline, offer, benefits, quote, stats). Show ALL selected templates in one message.

**Source-of-truth rules:**
- Brand-voice slots (headlines, subheads, offers, manifesto copy) ← `brand-dna.md` Voice in Practice
- Product-claim slots (benefits, stats, ingredients, taglines, comparisons) ← the product's DNA file
- Read the template's prompt text for length/format hints and fit content to them
- Invent + mark ⚠️ ONLY when neither source has the answer (review counts, star ratings, customer names, press coverage, specific stats). Never leave `[BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS]` — always suggest a value.

Open with:
> "Here's the campaign brief — filled from your brand and product DNA. Items marked ⚠️ are invented because neither source had the info. Say 'go' to build the prompts, or change anything."

Label every element (`Headline:`, `Claims:`, `Stats:`, `Review:`, `Offer:`, `Weaknesses:`, `Strengths:`...) with one short question per template. One-word answers work; "go" approves everything as shown. Wait for one response.

## Step 5 — Build and deliver the prompts

For each selected template, read its full text from `.claude/skills/ad-generator/templates.md` and replace every `[BRACKETED PLACEHOLDER]`:

- `[BRAND]` → brand name · `[YOUR PRODUCT]` → product name
- Color placeholders → the brand's color system (name + hex), respecting its Off-limits list
- **Contrast rule — always enforce:** light/pale background → dark text; dark background → white/light text. State the chosen text color explicitly in the prompt.
- Brief answers fill their slots; never introduce values that weren't shown in the brief.

**Product anchor — every template, no exception:** find the first `Create:` in the filled template text and replace everything before it with:

```
The provided reference image shows the exact product that must appear in this ad. Do not invent, modify, or substitute this product — it must look identical to the reference image: shape, label, colors, and packaging.

Create: [rest of filled template text]
```

**Template 14:** single product only — ignore the bundle/second-product structure.
**Aspect ratio:** the ratio stated at the end of the template's own text wins over the menu label if they differ.

Then deliver. Per template, output exactly this — the prompt in its own fenced code block so it copies in one click:

> ### [NN] — [Template name] · [ratio]
>
> ```
> [the complete filled prompt]
> ```

After the last prompt, generate — through the gate:

1. **Product photo.** If the user hasn't sent one yet, ask: "Send ONE clean photo of the product — sharp, well-lit, simple background. The prompt treats it as ground truth, so the better the photo, the truer the ad." Upload it to Higgsfield per the protocol (it is `medias[0]`, role `image`, for every ad).
2. **One generation card for the whole set**: one row per template — `gpt_image_2`, quality high, resolution 2k, that template's aspect ratio (the ratio at the end of the template text), the preflighted cost — then the total, the current balance and the balance after. STOP.
3. On an explicit ok: generate every ad on the card (`generate_image_batch` for 2+ ads, then `jobs_wait` and one `show_generation_by_ids`), then the credits line. One line: *"Text rendering varies between runs — if a word comes out mangled, I can regenerate that one (new card)."*
4. Reruns, other ratios or more templates = a new card.

If the user says **só o prompt**, close instead with the original usage instructions (adapt the ratio list to what was actually delivered):

> **How to generate your ad(s):**
> 1. Open your image tool — **GPT Image** (ChatGPT → attach image) works best; any strong image model that accepts a reference image is fine.
> 2. **Attach ONE clean photo of your product** — sharp, well-lit, simple background. The prompt treats it as ground truth, so the better the photo, the truer the ad.
> 3. Paste the prompt. If your tool has an aspect-ratio setting, set it to **[ratio]** (otherwise the prompt's ratio line handles it).
> 4. Generate. Text rendering varies between runs — if a word comes out mangled, just run it again. Regenerating is normal, not a failure.
> 5. Save the ones you love. Run me again anytime for more templates or another product.

Also save each delivered prompt to `brands/[brand]/ad-prompts/[NN]-[template-slug].md` (create the folder; overwrite freely — these are regenerable) so the user can come back to them without re-running the flow.

## Notes

- The single biggest quality lever is the product photo the user attaches — clean packshot in, premium ad out.
- If a brand's site can't be fetched (blocked, JS-only), fall back to the manual form — never guess brand facts.
- To update brand identity later, edit `brands/[brand]/brand-dna.md` directly — every future prompt reads it.
- One prompt = one ad. For variations, regenerate — same prompt, new roll (on Higgsfield: a new card).
- ⚠️ items (invented reviews, customer names, star counts, press logos, stats) are placeholders: remind the user once, at delivery, to swap them for real ones before publishing an ad.
