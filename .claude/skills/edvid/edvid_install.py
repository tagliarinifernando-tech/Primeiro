"""One-command installer for the edvid skill.

    uv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fillrochaa/edvid/main/edvid_install.py

`uv run <url>` and not `uvx --from <package>`: uvx would resolve and install the
whole edvid dependency tree — torch, pandas, numpy — merely to run a script that
imports nothing but the stdlib. Measured: 2+ minutes and a from-source build of
pandas, versus 0.4s for the script. Same reason this file stays stdlib-only.

This is the `npx create-video@latest` shape. What it buys over a README full of
shell snippets:

  - ONE command, byte-identical on macOS, Linux and Windows PowerShell. Every
    OS difference (home directory, path separators, no chmod, no symlinks) is
    handled here in Python instead of in two or three shell variants that drift
    apart.
  - No clone step and no symlink/junction, so nothing needs admin rights.
  - It finds the agent by itself — Claude Code, Codex, or anything else with a
    skills directory — instead of asking the user which one they run.
  - It verifies ffmpeg and Node afterwards and prints the exact install command
    for THEIR platform when something is missing.

Deliberately stdlib-only: it has to run before anything is installed.
